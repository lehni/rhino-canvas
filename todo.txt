Applet -- but how?

- determine usual pattern
-- document? window? 
-- rename window to frame?
-- let window point to the current window, so setOnKeydown etc. work consistently?
-- document.getElementById("..")

- predefine a canvas image?
- where to get key events (canvas image? Applet element?)
- define Canvas object name via applet parameter?


Done
