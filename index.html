<h1>Rhino Canvas</h1>

<h2>Rhino What?!</h2>

<p>Rhino Canvas is an implementation of the WHATWG Canvas API for 
the Rhino Javascript engine. The original purpose was to experiment with
drawString() implementations for the Canvas element, in particular for the MiniJoe.com 
Canvas API implementation. However, it may also be useful for some other stuff:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Do graphics in Javascript in a non-proprietary way</li>
<li>Experiment with the Canvas API without needing a browser (and a dummy HTML page)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Help Wanted</h2>

<p>There are several open issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The project needs a better logo</li>
<li>The Rhino debugger needs to be integrated with the IDE</li>
<li>A watchdog thread that is able to interrupt the interpreter is needed. All timer
  based calls run in the AWT event handling queue to simplify graphics synchronization, 
  so an infinite loop in a callback is fatal for the whole environment.
<ul>
