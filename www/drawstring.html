<h1>CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawString()</h1>

<a name="intro" ></a>
<h2>What is the Problem?</h2>

<p>Currently, the Canvas API does not include the ability to draw text strings. That makes
several potentional Canvas applications, such as dynamic graphs or maps, more complex than
neccessary. Instead of using the text facilities of the platform, Canvas applications 
need to bundle their own vector fonts or use inaccessible pre-rendered images for 
text display.</p>

<h2>How can this Situation be Improved?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, adding a <em>drawString</em>() method is not as simple as it may seem;
there are several more or less complex requirements that need to be taken into account:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Accessability</dt>
 <dd>The drawString method should not reduce accessability.</dd>

 <dt>Consistency</dt>
 <dd>The drawString method should be consistent with the remainder of the Canvas API.</dd>

 <dt>Performancy<dt>
 <dd>Unneccessary temporary objects should be avoided</dd>

 <dt>I18N</dt>
 <dd>drawString should work for all languages that are supported by HTML (introduce no additional constraints)</dd>

 <dt>Query Capabilities</dt>
 <dd>The author should be able to query the actual size of the text bounding box. </dd>
 
</dl>


<a name="requirements" ></a>
<h2>Requirement Discussion</h2>


<h3>Accessability</h3>

<p>Authors may reduce accessability by replacing regular
HTML content with a Canvas and calls to drawString().
 However, without drawString(), game designers may 
be tempted to use images with rendered text to display in-game messages (as in
several Canvs text hacks). From an accessability point of view, drawString() has two
advantages over the image approach: 

<ul>
<li>The browser text magnification mechanism could be applied, 
improving accessability at least for people with limited vision.</li>

<li>It would be possible to render the canvas content to 
a tactile graphics display (e.g. <a href="http://www.kgs-america.com/dvs.htm">dvs-1</a>), 
replacing regular characters with braille characters.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Applying the browser text magnification mechanism to drawString() requires 
that the size of the text bounding box can be queried, so the content can adopt 
to enlarged labels dynamically.</p>   

<h3>Consistency</h3>

<p>Other (complex) Canvas rendering properties such as the fill style are set 
via properties of the class CanvasRenderingContext2D. For <em>fillStyle</em>, 
supported values are CSS color values ("rgb(r,g,b)", "#fff" etc.) or special
style objects (LinearGradient, Pattern, RadialGradient), created via the context object
(createLinearGradient()...). </p>


<h3>I18N</h3>

<p>Fortunately, most internationalization issues are solved implicitly by 
using unicode characters. For displaying
<a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-October/007457.html">Ruby</a> 
annotations properly, it is necessary to be able to query text boundaries. </p>


<h3>Query Capabilities</h3>

<p>Without query capabilities for the text bounding box, it is impossible to
<a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-October/007460.html">avoid overlapping content</a>, 
in particular if the user is able to change the text size.</p>

<p>Also, the accessability and I18N requirements depend on the availability of 
this information.</p>

<p>The size of the bounding box depends on the actual font, which may differ from 
the requested font. The string width of several characters may differ from the
sum of all character widths when kerning is supported.</p>


<h2>Font Properties</h2>

<p>CSS1 Defines a set of font properties that could be relevant for a Canvas drawString() method:</p>
<ul>
<li>font-family</li>
<li>font-style</li>
<li>font-variant</li>
<li>font-weight</li>
<li>font-size</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the font properties, there are additional properties that could be taken
into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>word-spacing</li>
<li>letter-spacing</li>
<li>text-decoration</li>
<li>vertical-align</li>
<li>text-transform</li>
<li>text-align</li>
<li>line-height</li>
</ul>

<p>The properties <em>text-align</em> and <em>vertical-align</em> make much sense to 
properly align a label with a given point of reference.</p>

<p>CSS2 defines even more properties. While support for the font and alignement 
attributes seems to be a good starting point, the API should take into account that 
future versions may want to add support for more CSS properties.</p>


<h2>Existing Proposals</h2>

<p>In addition to solutions based on a separate Font or TextStyle object, there 
were two alternative proposals, <em>drawElement(e)</em> and a more minimalistic approach 
by Andrew Fedoniouk.</p>


<h3>drawElement(e)</h3>

<p>This powerful approach was originally 
<a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-October/007381.html">suggested 
by Gervase Markham</a>. The basic idea is to use the built-in HTML renderer to render a given 
subtree to an image object. 

<p>While <em>drawElement(e)</em> would also be a nice addition for the Canvas API, it 
does not replace a simple basic API for drawing labels with query capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>In contrast to the API sketched below, the drawElement proposal does not provide
access to the metrics of the selected font. Access to font metrics is necessary to
address the accessability and I18N requirements.</li>
<li>Rendering to an intermediate image is resource consuming.</li>
<li>The constructing of an intermediate DOM node just to display a label makes the
programs code less readable.
</ul>

<p>Since drawElement(e) does not replace drawString(), its inclusion (specification, problems)
should be discussed separately.</p>

<!-- Despite its beauty, some hard problems remain, in particular 
CSS inheritance rules for elements drawn out of context, and embedded objects such as 
images, Canvas elements, or Forms. The proposal seems very appealing in particular for 
bulk text. Bulk text, however, is probably better placed in the main document for various 
reasons, including accessability. Using drawElement()  for dynamic content (scores, labels 
in maps retreived from a server) seems problematic, and there is no simple way to obtain 
text metrics at a fine-grained level. Also, this approach does not help when the
Canvas API is used outside of the browser context, where no DOM is available.</p>  -->
 

<h3>Minimalist Approach</h3>

<p>Andrew Fedoniouk suggested a nice 
<a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-October/007376.html">minimalist approach</a>:</p>

<pre>
Graphics.setFont(FontOrFamilyName, size, weight, ...);
Graphics.setTextAlignment(horizontal, vertical);
Graphics.getFontAscent();
Graphics.getTextWidth(string);
Graphics.drawText(x,y,string);
</pre>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that it does not require a separate <em>Font</em> 
or <em>TextStyle</em> object. However, it seems difficult to remember the correct
order of parameters in setFont(). Also, when more font or text properties are added,
the GraphicsContext class may get cluttered too much.</p>


<a name="api"></a>
<h2>API Proposal</h2>

<p>Because of the issues described above, <a href="../index.html">rhino-canvas</a>
implements a simple, string-based solution  with a separate TextStyle object:</p>



<pre>
interface CanvasRenderingContext2D {

  // colours and styles
  attribute CanvasTextStyle textStyle; // (default black)
  
  CanvasTextStyle createTextStyle();
  CanvasTextStyle createTextStyle(  // shortcut
     in DOMString fontStyleVariantWeight, 
     in DOMString fontSize, 
     in DOMString fontFamily); 
     
  void drawString(in float x, in float y, in DOMString text);
  
  [ ...Remainder of CanvasRenderingContext2D omitted... ]
}


interface CanvasTextStyle {
  // relative values and inherit are not supported!

  attribute DOMString fontFamily; /
  attribute DOMString fontStyle;
  attribute DOMString fontVariant;
  attribute DOMString fontWeight;
  attribute DOMString fontSize;

  attribute DOMString textDecoration;
  attribute DOMString verticalAlign;
  attribute DOMString textTransform;
  attribute DOMString textAlign; // justify not supported 

  float stringWidth(in DOMString s); 
  float getHeight(); // ascent + descent + leading
  float getBaselinePosition(); // ascent + leading
  float getAscent();
  float getDescent();
  float getLeading();
  
  
// perhaps add those later...
//  attribute DOMString wordSpacing;  
//  attribute DOMString letterSpacing;
};
</pre>

<h2>Processing Model and Error Handling</h2>

<p>If the requested font is not available, the broser choses the best fit, determined by
the CSS font selection algorithm. All query methods return properties of the actually
selected font, not the requested font.</p>

<h2>Why would Browsers Implement this Feature?</h2>

<p>There is much user demand for this feature on the WHATWG mailing list, and the feature 
completes the 2D canvas API. Moreover, it is simple and straight-forward to implement; 
it can be mapped more or less directly to the underlying graphics 
API of the platform. </p>


<h2>Why would Authors Use this Feature?</h2>

<p>Using this feature would simplify several graph- and map related applications. 
In the long term, authors will prefer this feature over alternatives (inaccessible
images, vector fonts, proprietary plugins) because it provides a better user experience (loading
time, accessability), combined with a simpler programming model.</p>


<h2>What Evidence is there that this Feature is Desparately Needed?</h2>

<p>There have been a lot of requests for a <em>drawString</em>() method in the Canvas API
on the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list">WHATWG mailing list</a>.</p>
